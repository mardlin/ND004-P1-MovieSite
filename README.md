# Nanodegree Moviesite

This is a simple site that generates the HTML for a site listing some movies I'm fond of.

In order to better understand how the fresh_tomatoes.py script generates the 
HTML, I challenged myself to change the interface slightly. 

###Changes from the original layout: 

- Added new instance variables to the movies class
- Added a dropdown menu requiring an extra HTML generating function
- Placed each movie in its own "tab-panel" to present more information

### To run:

$ python entertainment_center.py
